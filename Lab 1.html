    <p><em>In 2001,</em> my parents blessed the human race with another fine addition to the population. They would have a total of four kids before they realized that kids were too much work and took the fun out of marriage and everything else.
        All jokes aside, I was lucky to have grown up with some of the best friends anyone could ask for. The hand-me-downs were also a great bonus. While growing up a lot of my intrests included hockey, rugby, and football. Having three siblings was also great for that because it worked out to 
    even teams. My other big intrests would of had to have been video games and comic books. Not much has changed, except for the amount of Batman comics/merchandise I own, along with all the videogames I've accumulated over the years. I attended highschool at Bear Creek Secondary School, where 
I would play on their football and rugby team all four years I was there. I was born in Newmarket, where much of my family resides today. My parents moved us down to Barrie when we were too young to remember, and we have been living here ever since. My goals for this year are to 
understand and develop skills in the computer programing field. One day, my goal is to be able to develop video games as I love to play them and I would love it even more to see my own ideas come to life through video games. </p>
